* Tutorial codes about Plasmo.jl

* Note that Plasmo.jl well represents optimization problem in hypergraph, so it can use graph partitioning method for hypergraph. 
* In this example, KaHyPar.jl is be used as one of the famous graph partitioning methods, however, it is not available for window OS. Therefore, Window Subsystem Linux (WSL) can be an alternative solution for this problem.
